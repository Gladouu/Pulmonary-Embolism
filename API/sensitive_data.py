This file is present in this directory only for the demonstration of this project. For obvious security reasons, such files should not be sent to the directory. 

The file where you use bcrypt to hash passwords should be stored on a development or production server, as appropriate. It is important to note that this file should never be sent to a public repository or shared with others, as it contains sensitive information that could be used to access your application or database.

It is best to store this file in a secure location, such as a password-protected directory, and to limit access to this file to those who need to see it. It is also important to ensure that those who have access to this file have been trained in best security practices to protect sensitive information.

Alternatively, this information could be stored in a third-party secret storage service, such as Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
