# Pylmonary Embolism 
<p style="text-align: justify;">

This repository contains, **for the moment**, only an API for the prediction of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) from DICOM images.

This API is the project of my [MLOps training](https://datascientest.com/formation-ml-ops) with the Data Scientest organization.   
The Machine Learning Engineer training leads to a certificate issued by MINES ParisTech | PSL Executive Education. The validation of the skills developed during this training allows the validation of the entire RNCP 36129 certification "Project Manager in Artificial Intelligence" of level 7 (equivalent to BAC+5).

This project is inspired by the RSNA competition in 2020 as well as the JFR Data Challenge in 2022, which I had the chance to participate in with the Thales Data Science team. 

These competitions propose to develop a Machine Learning algorithm to detect and characterize instances of pulmonary embolism on chest CT studies.

**Available soon in this directory, my pulmonary embolism detection algorithm.**
